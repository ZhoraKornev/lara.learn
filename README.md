## Introduction

This project leverages the Laravel framework to build a web application, following best practices and modern PHP development standards. Laravel Sail will be used to create an isolated environment for development, allowing you to focus on the application code without worrying about system dependencies.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) (for running Laravel Sail)
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) (for managing PHP dependencies)
- A text editor or IDE (e.g., VS Code, PHPStorm)

## Setting Up the Project

### 1. Create a New Laravel Project

First, use Composer to create a new Laravel project:

```bash
composer create-project laravel/laravel example-app
